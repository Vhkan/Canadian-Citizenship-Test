      <p className="about-app-creation">The idea of the üçÅCanadian Citizenship Test application wasn't chosen by accident by us, 
      a team of two developers. There was a time when both of us came to Canada, and after a certain period, we had to prepare 
      for the Citizenship Test in order to become citizens of Canada. We were looking for a helpful and useful application to get ready 
      for the test. Finding one at that time was not an easy task. So, the decision was made to develop this application for future newcomers 
      to Canada dreaming of becoming its citizens, like us the other day. Once it was a dream to come to Canada and become its citizen. Later, 
      it was a dream to become a software developer. Dream, as dreams come true!</p>
